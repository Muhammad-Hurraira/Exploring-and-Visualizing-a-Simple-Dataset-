# Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

This project showcases how to explore and visualize the famous Iris dataset using Python. It demonstrates core data analysis techniques and data visualization skills using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project is ideal for beginners learning exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 🔍 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic in the machine learning and data science community. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*.

In this notebook, we:

- Load and inspect the Iris dataset  
- Understand the structure and types of data  
- Perform basic data cleaning (if needed)  
- Visualize relationships between features using various plots  
- Identify patterns and trends using graphical and numeric summaries  

## 📊 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – for creating static, interactive visualizations  
- **Seaborn** – for beautiful and informative statistical graphics  

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Understand the distribution and relationships between features in the Iris dataset  
- Practice exploratory data analysis (EDA) with well-known Python tools  
- Develop a foundation for future machine learning workflows  

## 📁 File Structure

- `Exploring_and_Visualizing_a_Simple_Dataset.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and visualizations  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Install required packages**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Launch the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Exploring_and_Visualizing_a_Simple_Dataset.ipynb
   ```

## 📌 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with the following columns:

- **sepal length (cm)**
- **sepal width (cm)**
- **petal length (cm)**
- **petal width (cm)**
- **species** (target variable)

You can find the dataset in the `sklearn.datasets` module or load it directly from popular online sources.
